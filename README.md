# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It shows how complex life-like behaviour can emerge from the simpplest rules.


### Rules

1.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.

2.Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

3.All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Seed

When the page is loaded, live cells are placed at random.
